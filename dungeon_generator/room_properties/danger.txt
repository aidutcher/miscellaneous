where gravity is reversed
that is under the effect of the Silence spell
that has no floor
where the floor is lava
where occupants are compelled to dance
where the floor is warped and rippled
where the windows open into another plane
that is flooded floor to ceiling
where a strong wind is constantly blowing
that is under the effect of the darkness spell
that is lit with pure sun light
that is overgrown by plants and vines
that contains {} physical traps
that contains {} arcane traps
where everything inside is invisible
that is constantly spinning
where the entrances and exits disappear upon entry
where magic does not work
that is filled with snakes
